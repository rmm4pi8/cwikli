cwikli is a python program that returns Wiktionary definitions on the command line

advantages
* one dictionary program that works for Latin, Greek, and most modern languages that is trivial to install
* large, high-quality, and up-to-date dictionary but faster and less distracting than using a web-based dictionary in your browser
* accepts most inflected forms for Latin, German, and Romance languages
* uses native operating system keymappings or on-screen keyboard for input of non-Latin characters

disadvantages
* requires internet access
* output is ugly--if a lot of people start using the program I will probably fix this
* new and probably has lots of bugs
